<p>Join <i>Travel Scotland!</i> for a two-week tour of the Hebrides. The trip
takes you to four of the beautiful Hebridean islands, including Fingal's
Cave, featured in Medelssohn's <i>The Hebrides</i> Overture.</p>
<p>The tour starts with a train tour of the Highlands from Glasgow to Fort
William. After an overnight stay in Fort William, we leave by train and ferry
to the Isle of Skye. While there, you'll have a chance to tour Dunvegan
Castle and visit the Black Cullins in southern Skye. A boat trip to Mallaig
follows and tour through Moidart where we'll visit the most western point in
Great Britain.</p>
<p>No tour of the Hebrides can be complete with a visit to Iona and Fingal's
Cave. Plenty of time will be available for touring the abbey at Iona and 
touring the ruins. Pay your respects at the grave of St. Columba who, as
the legends tell it, was a disciple of St. Patrick and brought Christianity
to the Highlands.</p>
<p>You'll spend the next three days in Oban and on the Isle of Jura. Be sure
to take some time to sample its world-famous scotch! The
trip concludes with two days in Glasgow.</p>

<p>The <i>Highlands Tour</i> continues to be our most popular tour. This
two-week excursion takes you to some of the most awe-inspiring
scenery in Scotland; yet provides plenty of shopping time and sight-seeing
in the beautiful city of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The trip begins with two days in Glencoe, the site of the famous
massacre of the MacDonald clan by the Stewarts. Take some time to go hiking.
Several movies have been filmed in Glencoe, including <i>Braveheart</i> and
<i>Highlander</i>. Maybe you'll get a chance to be an extra in this year's
production!</p>
<p>From Glencoe, the tour travels north, following the trail of Bonnie
Prince Charlie to Glenfinnan. You'll also take a boat trip to view castle
ruins along the Kyle of Lochalsh. A trip to Loch Ness follows. Perhaps
you'll see Nessie!</p>
<p>For city-dwellers, you'll enjoy the next three days in Edinburgh. Do some
shopping along the Royal Mile, or climb Arthur's Seat for a awesome view of
the city. If you love castles, visit Edinburgh castle and Sterling castle too.</p>
<p>The tour concludes with a trip to Glasgow.</p>
