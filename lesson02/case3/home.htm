   <h1>Check that Pen!</h1>
   <p>ESPN is reporting that Houston running back JT Olson has come to terms
   with team, signing a three-year deal for $12 million. "I'm really happy
   with the contract," claims JT, "and I'm looking forward to holding out next
   year for a new contract after winning the rushing title." Yo Texas, check
   JT's pen to make sure it wasn't filled with disappearing ink!</p>

   <h1>A Cheesy Monument</h1>
   <p>Green Bay native Jeff Miller loves Packer QB Todd Rodgers. And he loves
   the Packers. And he loves cheese. So what could be more natural than carving
   a life-size statue of his beloved player in a huge block of gouda? Speaking of
   natural, Jeff's wife starting to complain about the natural odor of the 
   monument. "I suppose I'll have to give it up," sighs Jeff. For his
   next creation, Jeff can do the entire porous GB defense ... in swiss cheese; 
   or he can simply do a statue of beleagured
   GB defense back Chris Conners in toast.</p>

   <h1>Jenkins on Ice</h1>
   <p>Retired b-baller Dennis Jenkins announced today that he has signed a
   contract with "Long Sleep" to have his body frozen before death, to
   be revived only when medical science has discovered a cure to the aging
   process. "Lots of guys get frozen for cancer and stuff, " explains the 
   always-entertaining Jenkins, "I just want to return once they 
   can give me back my eternal youth.[sic]" Perhaps Jenkins is also hoping 
   medical science can cure his free-throw shooting  - 47% and falling during his 
   last year in the league.</p>
   <p>A reader tells us that Jenkins may not be aware that part
   of the process of "Long Sleep" is to remove the head, keeping only the
   brain to be revived. This would be a problem for Jenkins since he would be 
   left with his least-valuable asset.</p>
