   <h1>Solving the Quadratic Equation</h1>
   <p>A <b>quadratic equation</b> is a polynomial equation of the second degree, having 
   the general form:</p>

   <p id="eq1">
   </p>

   <p>The letters a, b and c are called coefficients: a is the coefficient of 
   <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, b is the coefficient of <i>x</i>, and c is the constant coefficient. 
   A quadratic equation has two complex roots (i.e., solutions for the unknown term <i>x</i>.) 
   In some cases, these roots can have the same value. The roots can also belong to the realm 
   of <b>complex numbers</b>. The values of the roots can be computed using the <b>quadratic 
   formula</b> as shown below:</p>

   <p id="eq2">
   </p>

    <p>For example, the roots of the quadratic equation</p>

   <p id="eq3">
   </p>

   <p>can be determined by first substituting 2 for a, -14 for b, and 20 for c</p>

   <p id="eq4">
   </p>

   <p>and then solving the expression, which gives the roots of the equation as either <i>x</i> = 5 or <i>x</i> = 2.</p>
