    <product>DigiCam
        <question>What is the difference between optical and digital zoom?</question>
        <answer>With optical zoom, the Digicam's lens physically moves inside the camera; with digital zoom, the
camera's processor zooms the image electronically. If you zoom too much, your image will become
pixelated.</answer>
        <question>What sort of batteries should I use with the DigiCam?</question>
        <answer>Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries work the best and have the longest lifetime. Nickel-cadium
batteries also work very well, as do alkaline batteries. Do not use lithium batteries.</answer>
        <question>What resolution should I use for 4x6-inch photos?</question>
        <answer>We recommend 640x480 for 4x6-inch images, 1024x768 for 5x7-inch photos, and 1600x1200 for 8x10-inch
