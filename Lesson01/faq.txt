DigiCam

What is the difference between optical and digital zoom?

With optical zoom, the Digicam's lens physically moves inside the camera; with digital zoom, the
camera's processor zooms the image electronically. If you zoom too much, your image will become
pixelated.

What sort of batteries should I use with the DigiCam?

Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries work the best and have the longest lifetime. Nickel-cadium
batteries also work very well, as do alkaline batteries. Do not use lithium batteries.

What resolution should I use for 4x6-inch photos?

We recommend 640x480 for 4x6-inch images, 1024x768 for 5x7-inch photos, and 1600x1200 for 8x10-inch
photos.

Can the DigiCam be harmed by airport X-ray machines?

No, there is no evidence that X-ray machines can affect the performance of the DigiCam or the quality of
DigiCam photos.
