         <h2>The Andromeda Galaxym31</h2>
         <p><img src="m31.jpg">The Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest large galaxy. At
            a distance of 2.9 million light years, the galaxy is one of the
            chief items in the "Local Group" of galaxies, which includes our own.m31
         </p>
         <p>Andromeda can be easily glimpsed by the naked eye under even 
            moderate viewing conditions. The Persian astronomer Al-Sufi referred
            to M31 as "the little cloud." The first telescopic description of
            M31 is credited to Simon Marius in 1612. Andromeda is easily the most 
            studied galaxy because it allows us to observe features of our own Milky 
            Way galaxy from the outside.

         <h2>The Crab Nebulam01</h2>
         <p><img src="m01.jpg">The Crab Nebula is one of the most famous supernova
            remnants in the night sky. The supernova was first noted on July 4, 1054, by
            Chinese astronomers. At its height, the supernova was about 4 times
            brighter than Venus and could be seen during the day for a period of more than
            three weeks.m01
         </p>
         <p>The remnant of the this supernova was discovered in 1731 by the British
            astronomer John Bevis. Messier himself found it in 1758 while looking for
            Halley's comet. He soon realized it was no comet and the Crab Nebula became
            the first entry in Messier's famous catalog of celestial objects.

            ever discovered. It is probably similar in structure to the
            Ring Nebula (M57), though its appearance is very different due to
            the angle by which it's viewed.m27
         </p>
         <p>The nebula is also one of the brightest of its kind. It can
            easily be seen in a pair of 10x50 binoculars on a clear night in
            a dark sky location. The outer halo extends in size to about half
            the diameter of a full moon.

            distant constellation Serpens. The source of light for M16
            is the high-energy radiation of the massive young stars being
            formed in its core. By studying M16, astronomers hope to learn
            more about the early years of our own Sun.m16
         </p>
         <p>Philippe Loys de Cheseaux discovered the nebula in 1745. Charles
            Messier was the first to notice that the stars in M16 appear to emit
            a faint glow, providing the first clues that the nebula was a
            stellar nursery.

            visible to the naked eye on clear nights in dark sky locations.m13

         <p>The cluster contains perhaps as many as 500,000 stars, though some 
            estimates push that number up to a million. M13 is estimated to be 
            about 14 billion years old, which places the date of its origin near to 
            the date of the galaxy's birth.

         <p>The Ring Nebula contains a central star, discovered by the German

            of the great challenges of amatuer astronomy. The star itself is a
            planet-sized white dwarf. The Ring Nebula was probably formed when
            this central star exploded long ago.

            away. M51 is easy to see under dark sky conditions, but it is quite

         <p>The smaller galaxy NGC5195 is sometimes referred to as "M51B," while

            galaxy. The interaction of the two objects compressed and disturbed the
            gas in several regions, resulting the formation of new young stars.
