      <title>Visual Memory</title>
      <link>vm.htm</link>
      <description>BOULDER, Colorado - The ability to retain memory about the 
      details of a natural scene is unaffected by the distraction of another 
      activity and this information is retained in "working memory" according 
      to researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. These 
      results reinforce the notion that humans maintain useful information about 
      previous fixations in long-term working memory rather than the 
      limited capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM).

      <title>Neptune probe launches</title>

      <description>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida - The fastest spacecraft ever launched 
      began the first full day of its 2-billion mile journey to Neptune, where it 
      will study the gas giant and provide close-up images of its rings. The Neptune 5 
      spacecraft blasted off aboard an Atlas V rocket Sunday evening in a spectacular 
      start to the $900 million mission. The spacecraft can reach 38,000 mph, taking 6 
      years to reach Neptune and the outer reaches of the Solar System.

      <title>Whale numbers in decline</title>
      <link>whales.htm</link>
      <description>ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A survey of beluga whales in Cook Inlet finds 
      that their numbers remain stagnant and could be declining despite efforts to get 
      the white whale population to rebound. Biologists with the NOAA conducted an aerial 
      survey southwest of Anchorage early last summer to count the belugas. An analysis 
      of the survey data indicates there were an estimated 324 beluga whales in Cook Inlet 
      in 2007, down from 376 the year before.

      <title>Satellite goes silent</title>

      <description>LOS ANGELES, California - A NASA satellite studying the Earth's Van 
      Allen Belt has stopped operating after three years, the space agency announced 
      over the weekend. The satellite, launched in 2004, successfully completed its 
      two-year primary mission, according to a NASA news release. It made observations 
      until last month when engineers discovered that its power supply had failed.
